***HOW TO MAKE***
-----------------
1) driver program: ht438_drv.c

This program handles all the driver functions: open, read, write,
ioctl/dump, release. It also initializes and exits from the kernel
module. Responsible for all kernel level activity.

2) test program: assignment3.c

This program handles the file input and pthreads. It scans files
for commands for driver function to use. Responsible for all user
level activity.

3) header files: ht438_ioctl.h, ht_object.h

The first header file is for the definition of ioctl to include
dump args command. The second header file is the definition for
objects being hashed.

***HOW TO USE***
----------------
1) make all
2) sudo insmod ht438_drv.ko
3) output from drivers
4) sudo rmmmod ht438_drv.ko
5) make clean
